### Workflow: Order iPad Mini from ServiceNow Catalog

1. Navigate to iPad Mini Product Page
   Two valid approaches:
   a. Direct Navigation:
   - Action: `click(link="iPad mini")`
   - Location: Main catalog page
   - ✅ Success Pattern: Direct link is consistently available

   b. Alternative Navigation through Hardware Category:
   - Action 1: `click(link="Hardware")` or `click(link="Hardware. Order from a variety of hardware...")`
   - Action 2: `click(link="iPad mini")`
   - Location: Category Items region
   - ✅ Success Pattern: Both paths are reliable

2. Configure Product Options
   Important: Configuration must be completed in the correct sequence!

   a. Color Selection
   - Action: `click([color_selection_label])`
   - Location: "Choose the colour" radiogroup
   - Required: Yes (Mandatory field)
   - ⚠️ Implementation Notes:
     * Use label clicks for reliable interaction
     * Color selection must be made before storage
     * Wait for options to be visible before selecting

   b. Storage Configuration
   - Action: `click([storage_selection_label])`
   - Location: "Choose the storage" radiogroup
   - Required: Yes (Mandatory field)
   - ⚠️ Implementation Notes:
     * Select storage only after color is chosen
     * Use label elements for clicking rather than radio buttons
     * Verify selection before proceeding

3. Set Quantity
   - Action: `select_option("Quantity", [desired_quantity])`
   - Location: "Order this Item" section
   - Type: Dropdown/combobox selection
   - ✅ Success Pattern: Combobox interaction is consistently reliable

4. Complete Order
   - Action: `click(button="Order Now")`
   - Location: Bottom of form in "Order this Item" region
   - ✅ Success Pattern: Button is reliably clickable when all mandatory fields are completed

5. Order Confirmation
   - Expected Result: Redirect to order confirmation page
   - Optional Follow-up: `click(link="Back to Catalog")`
   - Location: Navigation section of confirmation page
   - ✅ Success Pattern: Confirmation page reliably appears after successful order

### Critical Implementation Notes:

1. Mandatory Field Requirements:
   - Color selection is required
   - Storage selection is required
   - Both must be completed before order submission
   - Form validation prevents submission if either is missing

2. Element Interaction Strategy:
   - Use label clicks for radio button selections
   - Utilize combobox interface for quantity selection
   - Ensure elements are visible before interaction
   - Follow the specific sequence: Color → Storage → Quantity → Order

3. Navigation Patterns:
   - Both direct and category-based navigation are valid
   - Category navigation includes a more detailed path but is equally reliable
   - Back to Catalog option is available after order completion

4. Error Prevention:
   - Verify each selection before proceeding
   - Ensure mandatory fields are populated
   - Check for confirmation page after order submission
   - Follow the prescribed sequence of actions

5. UI Characteristics:
   - Form follows a strict sequential order
   - Radio buttons should be accessed via labels
   - Quantity selection uses a dropdown interface
   - Order button becomes active only after all required fields are completed

This workflow has been optimized based on multiple successful execution traces and incorporates best practices for reliable automation of the iPad Mini ordering process.
